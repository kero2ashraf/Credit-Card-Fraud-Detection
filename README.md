# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The objective of a Credit Card Fraud Detection project using Machine Learning is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify and classify fraudulent credit card transactions from legitimate ones. By utilizing historical transaction data, this model aims to learn patterns, anomalies, and behaviors associated with fraudulent activities. The ultimate goal is to deploy a robust and reliable system that helps financial institutions and businesses detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time, thereby minimizing financial losses and protecting both customers and the organization from fraudulent activities.
